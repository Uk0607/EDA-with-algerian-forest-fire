# EDA-with-algerian-forest-fire
This project is Exploratory data analysis of the algerian forest fire dataset, In this project we can predict The feature FWI(Fire Weather Index) by taking input features as Temperature ,RH, WS, Rain, FFMC, DMC, ISI, Classes . EDA involves feature engineering, finding  any missing values, Identify relationships in dataset.
